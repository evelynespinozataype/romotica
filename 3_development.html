													<p>This phase involves the development of the applications and systems that will connect and control the physical objects (ubiquitous and wearable). The physical objects, applications, and systems are defined as components that are coupled one by one as the development progresses until the system is formed. In this phase, a component-based architecture is employed, where each component is coupled with its own functionalities one by one. This method decomposes the original big problem into a hierarchy of small problems.</p>

													<h3>Architecture based on components</h3>
													<p>An architecture based on components is used to shape the socioenactive system. Each physical object with specific functions that could work independently is defined as a component. Before developing the socioenactive system, designing the system architecture based on components is necessary. It will help to have a general view of the system. The system's components are the applications built to control the physical objects. The connection of the components will shape the socioenactive system. An advantage to working with components is that it allows them to be up-to-date without rebuilding them from scratch. Besides, it enables the development of large-scale systems.</p>

													<h3>Socioenactive Objects</h3>
													<p>The step involves the embedding of objects with ubiquitous or wearable technology. The physical objects could be created through 3D printing, made manually, or acquired on the market. Ubiquitous or/and wearable devices should be defined in this phase. These devices could have their own operating system and/or programming language. Applications are developed to control the physical objects. Each physical object with its application becomes a component that shapes the socioenactive system.</p>

													<h3>Embedding AI into the system</h3>
													<p>This phase involves developing an AI model that is embedded into the system later. This phase involves the following steps:</p>

															<h4>Unordered</h4>
															<ul>
																<li>Defining the ML/DL algorithm.</li>
																<p>This step involves reviewing potential ML (machine learning) or DL (deep learning) algorithms that will be used for the system, considering the context.</p>
																<li>Defining the dataset.</li>
																<p>This step involves acquiring structured, unstructured, or semi-structured datasets for the ML/DL algorithm. The dataset can be obtained from available repositories or/execute a sub-project to get the dataset, depending on the complexity of the dataset required.</p>
																<li>Pre-processing Dataset.</li>
																<p>The pre-processing step involves preparing and cleaning the dataset to make it more suitable for the ML/DL algorithm.</p>
																<li>Model Development.</li>
																<p>This step involves the development of the ML/DL model considering the context problem</p>
																<li>Training.</li>
																<p> This step involves splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. Next, train and test the ML/DL model created previously using the dataset.</p>
																<li>Model Results.</li>
																<p>After training the model, the next step is to evaluate the results to assess how well it performed and how reliable it is. Performance metrics are used to evaluate the results.</p>
																<li>Embedding the AI Model in the System.</li>
																<p>This step involves developing an application that contains the AI model; this application afterwards is embedded in the socioenactive system.</p>
