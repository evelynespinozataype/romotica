													<p>The first step in the building of socioenactive systems is to understand the fundamental concepts of the socioenactive approach, define the context to be tackled, and the technologies to be used.</p>
													
													<h3>Socioenactive</h3>
													<p>Socioenactive is conceived on the basis of the enactive approach, which considers the human brain, body, and the world are inseparable in constant and dynamic interaction. Under this basis, the socioenactive approach adds the social aspect, which allows the conception of the socioenactive unity, socioenactive coupling, and socioenactive dimensions in computational systems.</p>
													
													<h3>Socioenactive Unity</h3>
													<p>The socioenactive unity involves the human brain, body, and the environment shaped by people, physical objects, and computational systems. In this socioenactive unity, a continuous fluid dynamic process with feedback loops with external and internal orbits is involved that is constantly re-shaping, re-wiring, and re-modeling the human brain and body over micro short periods of time. In this process, human senses, perception, sensorimotor, cognition, and emotions are involved, considering culture, traditions, and personality aspects over time.</p>
													
													<h3>Socioenactive Dimensions</h3>
													<p>In the interactions among people and the socioenactive system, three dimensions emerge: social, physical, and digital. The social world is coupled to the digital world through physical mediation. This means that things (physical) are perceived and acted on the social world. Digital has in its composition computational representations coupled to the physical world. The three dimensions work in a loop; one dimension feeds back to another for its performance. The socioenactive cycle is characterized by the autonomy of the three dimensions based on social feedback.</p>
													
													<h3>Socioenactive Coupling</h3>
													<p>The socioenactive coupling involves the coupling between the social, physical, and digital worlds, considering the socioenactive unity. This coupling is grounded in the concept of bodily resonance. 
													In the illustration; A and B are two people, and C is a socioenactive system composed of their physical objects embedded with technologies.

													A undergoes an emotional expression, e.g., anger, which is manifested internally (through the heart rate, brain waves, temperature, etc) and externally (through facial, gestural, postural, etc) in his body in typical bodily changes. These propio, interoceptive bodily feelings and expressions are called intra-bodily resonance. However, this intra-bodily resonance becomes an external expression at the same time: the anger turns into visible and is directly perceived by B and C. 
													
													B not only sees the anger immediately in A’s face and gesture but also senses it with his own body through his intra-bodily resonance. 
													
													C through its technologies perceives the anger in A's brain and body but also processes it with its own algorithms/AI through its intra-digital resonance, producing reactions in the socioenactive system. However, it does not stay like this, for the bodily reaction caused in B and C in turn, becomes an expression perceived by A, causing another impression; it affects his bodily reaction, changes his body expression, however slightly, and so forth. Therefore, there is a circular interplay of expressions and reactions running in split seconds and constantly modifying each subject’s bodily state and the socioenactive system state.</p>
													
													<h3>Technologies</h3>
													<p>Socioenactive systems are built employing several technologies, based on ubiquitous and wearable technologies. In this step, is to explore the current technologies and the possibilities of employing them for the socioenactive system.</p>

													<h3>Context</h3>
													<p>The next step is to define the context in which the socioenactive system will be employed.</p>
